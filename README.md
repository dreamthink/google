<p><strong>OVERVIEW: </strong><br>
A mockup of the Google search page, this app playfully returns an "Internet is broken" error message no matter what the search term is and offers a low-tech activity for the user to do instead. This app is a reminder to take a break from technology every now and then.
</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong><br>
This was the first project where I implemented HTML5 Web Speech API for voice recognition, similar to the actual Google search page. It asks for the user's permission to access the device microphone for this feature. I learned that the exact font face for the Google main logo was a custom font, so I acquired the logo in an image format.
